# nginx role for Ansible
Install nginx deb package

## Set up
- Add this role and eventually it's dependencies in your `roles` folder as git submodule:
`git submodule add git@github.com/davinov/ansible-nginx [path-to-roles]/nginx`
- Add it to your playbook's roles if it's not required by another one
